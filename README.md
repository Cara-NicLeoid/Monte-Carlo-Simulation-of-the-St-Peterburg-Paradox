# Monte Carlo Simulation of the St Peterburg Paradox
 Monte Carlo Simulation of the St Petersburg Paradox in R. 


The St Petersburg Paradox is a  game. A dealer flips a fair coin,  if its  heads the player wins Â£2, and the  game  stops. If it is tails the game continues, the prize doubles in each round, until a heads is tossed and the game ends. There is a fee to play this game and  is charged in each round. The prize the player receives could be an infinite amount , however  after acknowledging fees,  the player could make a loss. To explore what is a reasonable fee one has created a Monte Carlo Simulation in R.
